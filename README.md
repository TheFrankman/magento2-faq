# FAQ Module for Magento 2

## Disclaimer
I built this module a long time ago. There are a lot of bad practices in here i.e. using M1 style admin form generation rather than the UI component approach.

## Summary

This is my first Magento 2 Module so there may be some issues and it's fairly basic. Feel free to submit pull requests with patches or extra fucntionality.
